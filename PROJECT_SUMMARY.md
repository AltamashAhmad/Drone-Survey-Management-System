# Drone Survey Management System - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Drone Survey Management System is a comprehensive platform for managing drone surveys, missions, and collected data. It consists of:

1. **Frontend**: React-based web application
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express API
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Work Completed

### Database Setup and Configuration

- Created and configured PostgreSQL database
- Implemented database schema with tables for users, drones, locations, missions, waypoints, logs, and data
- Added comprehensive dummy data for testing

### Backend Development

- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for all core functionalities
- Created controllers for handling business logic
- Implemented data validation and error handling
- Added database connection and schema verification scripts

### Frontend Development

- Fixed ESLint warnings and errors
- Removed unused variables and imports
- Fixed React hook dependency issues
- Ensured proper component structure

### Testing

- Created database check scripts to verify connection and schema
- Developed API endpoint testing scripts
- Implemented frontend-backend integration tests
- Created full-stack test scenarios

## System Features

- **Drone Management**: Add, update, delete, and track drones
- **Mission Planning**: Create and manage survey missions
- **Location Management**: Define and organize survey sites
- **Waypoint Management**: Define flight paths for missions
- **Data Collection**: Store and manage survey data
- **Reporting**: Generate survey reports and analytics

## Testing Results

The system has been thoroughly tested, with the following results:

- **Database**: All tables are properly created and accessible
- **API Endpoints**: Core endpoints are working correctly
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Data flows correctly between components
- **Full-Stack Tests**: Create, read, update, and delete operations work as expected

## Known Issues

1. The waypoints API endpoints have inconsistencies in naming and structure
2. The reports API endpoints are not fully implemented
3. Some advanced features need additional development

## Next Steps

1. Fix waypoint API endpoint issues
2. Complete the reports functionality
3. Enhance the frontend user interface
4. Add user authentication and authorization
5. Implement real-time mission tracking
6. Add data visualization for survey results

## Conclusion

The Drone Survey Management System is now functional for basic operations and ready for further development. The core features are working correctly, and the system architecture is solid and scalable.
