# Drone Survey Management System - Testing Results

## Database Testing

The database connection and schema were successfully tested. The following tables were verified:

- users
- drones
- locations
- missions
- waypoints
- mission_logs
- survey_reports
- collected_data

## Dummy Data

Dummy data was successfully added to the database for comprehensive testing:

- 4 users (admin, operator, pilot, analyst)
- 4 locations (construction site, solar farm, park, industrial complex)
- 5 drones with different statuses
- 4 missions (completed, in-progress, planned)
- 22 waypoints across all missions
- 17 mission logs
- 2 survey reports
- 9 collected data entries

## API Endpoint Testing

The following API endpoints were successfully tested:

### Health Endpoint
- GET /api/health - ✅ Working

### Drones Endpoints
- GET /api/drones - ✅ Working
- GET /api/drones/:id - ✅ Working
- POST /api/drones - ✅ Working
- PUT /api/drones/:id - ✅ Working
- DELETE /api/drones/:id - ✅ Working

### Locations Endpoints
- GET /api/locations - ✅ Working
- GET /api/locations/:id - ✅ Working
- POST /api/locations - ✅ Working
- PUT /api/locations/:id - ✅ Working

### Missions Endpoints
- GET /api/missions - ✅ Working
- GET /api/missions/:id - ✅ Working
- POST /api/missions - ✅ Working

### Waypoints Endpoints
- GET /api/waypoints/mission/:missionId - ❌ Not working properly

## Frontend-Backend Integration Testing

The frontend was successfully able to:

1. Connect to the backend API
2. Create a new drone and verify it was stored in the database
3. Retrieve the created drone and verify the data integrity
4. Create a new mission and verify it was stored in the database
5. Retrieve the created mission and verify the data integrity

## Issues Found

1. The waypoints API endpoints have issues:
   - The endpoint structure is inconsistent
   - The column names in the database don't match the API parameters (lat/lng vs. latitude/longitude)

2. The reports API endpoints are not implemented yet.

## Conclusion

The Drone Survey Management System is functioning well for core operations:
- User management
- Drone management
- Location management
- Mission planning

The system needs improvements in:
- Waypoint management
- Reports generation and access

Overall, the system is ready for basic operations but requires additional development for advanced features.
